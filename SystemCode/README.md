# Dengue-Prediction Demo ‚Äì Docker Edition üê≥

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop **24+** (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin)
- cd into the SystemCode directory (where this README is)

## Run this command in the terminal once Docker has been setup & initialized

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

* Assuming your docker build went well you should see a message like this:
  ![1745951017406](image/README/1745951017406.png)

## Once your build completes go to your browser (preferably chrome) and open http://localhost:3000/

- That's it! That link should open up the dengue prediction dashboard for you play with!
