## Dengue Outbreak Prediction System

## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Under Singapore’s tropical conditions and dense urban landscape, dengue fever continues to be a significant health concern, demanding targeted prevention strategies and data-driven predictive models. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based prediction system that can identify potential outbreak locations by analyzing key epidemiological, environmental, and weather-related factors.

By leveraging Intelligent Reasoning techniques and algorithms learned from course modules, the team will construct a predictive model that identifies meaningful relationships between these factors. The insights generated from this project aim to support dengue prevention efforts by strengthening prediction capabilities.

This initiative is particularly relevant to Singapore, where the constant influx of dengue cases necessitates proactive and data-driven solutions. By leveraging local government data sources, such as the National Environment Agency and data.gov.sg, this system aims to provide valuable insights that can support ongoing efforts to predict and mitigate outbreaks more effectively.

The primary goal of the project is to develop a model capable of delivering accurate predictions based on selected factors. Additionally, the project serves as an opportunity for us to apply Intelligent Reasoning concepts to a real-world problem, deepening our understanding of data-driven decision-making in epidemiological research.

## SECTION 5 : USER GUIDE

### Dengue-Prediction Demo – Docker Edition 🐳

#### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop **24+** (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose plugin)
- cd into the SystemCode directory

#### Run this command in the terminal once Docker has been setup & initialized

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Assuming your docker build went well you should see a message like this:
  ![Docker Build Success](SystemCode/image/README/1745951017406.png)

#### Once your build completes go to your browser (preferably chrome) and open http://localhost:3000/

- That's it! That link should open up the dengue prediction dashboard for you play with!
